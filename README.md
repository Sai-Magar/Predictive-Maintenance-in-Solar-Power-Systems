# Predictive Maintenance in Solar Power Systems

This project focuses on developing a predictive maintenance model for solar power systems by leveraging generation and weather sensor data. The goal is to predict potential failures or maintenance needs, ensuring efficient performance and minimizing downtime of solar energy plants. By analyzing key factors such as temperature, irradiation, and weather conditions, we can foresee issues and optimize maintenance schedules.

## Project Overview:
- **Objective**: Predict the need for maintenance in solar power systems based on historical data of power generation and weather conditions.
- **Datasets**: The project uses four datasets, including power generation and weather sensor data from two solar power plants.
- **Techniques**: We use feature engineering, data preprocessing, and machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model.

## Key Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Merge solar generation data with weather sensor data, handle missing values, and engineer new features such as time-based variables (hour, day, month).
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform data analysis to understand trends, correlations, and potential predictors of system failures.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: A **Random Forest Regressor** is used to predict the generated power (DC Power) based on weather conditions and time features.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 score to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: For data analysis and model building
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model implementation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and experimentation

## Future Improvements:
- Integration of real-time data for dynamic predictive maintenance.
- Exploration of other advanced models like Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, or Deep Learning approaches.
- Deployment of the predictive maintenance model on cloud platforms to monitor solar power systems in real-time.
